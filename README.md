# Congestive Heart Failure Detection Using Deep Learning

## Research Background
Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by the heart’s inability to pump blood adequately throughout the body without increased intra-cardiac pressure. Diverse approaches are used to treat CHF. These approaches, which include physical examination, echocardiography, and laboratory testing, require a high degree of competence to interpret findings and make diagnoses. Rather Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive test, may be used for CHF early diagnosis and revealed a significant correlation between heart failure (HF) and ECG features. This project proposes deep-learning techniques—recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures to create a diagnostic algorithm that achieves high accuracy with limited information and automated feature extraction.

## Project Overview
This repository contains research and implementation of deep learning techniques to detect Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) using ECG data. By employing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures, the project aims to create a diagnostic algorithm that achieves high accuracy with automated feature extraction.
